Publibishing on GNUBOOK.

Access your blog by gnubook.org/your_avatar. Login with the password for the admin view. Drag-n-drop all your resources in the browser window: txt files become blog posts, image fill in the gallery while you can always choose to drop whatever type of file in a magic pot.

First step, use the password box and salt fields to create the hash to insert in the config file of gnubook. Remember to deliver the hash to us, at info@gnubook.org specifying your blog name.

We reserve the right to change the salt value.

Same about customizing your blog skinner (skinner.html), write down your code and deliver to us to the same coordinates.
